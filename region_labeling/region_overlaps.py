    Parameters
    ----------
    atlas_names : str or list of str
        Grab atlas from web given the name. Few are shipped with FSL
        and Nilearn.
        Valid options:  ['harvard_oxford', 'destrieux', 'diedrichsen',
                         'juelich', 'jhu', 'mist', 'yeo_networks7',
                         'yeo_networks17']

    dimension : int
        Dimension of the DiFuMo atlas (4D).

    Returns
    -------
    info : dict
        Contains meta-data assigned to each atlas name such as
        overlap proportion, etc
        Each atlas dict contains following attributes:

                dot product between DiFuMo regions and regions in target
                atlas (existing pre-defined)

            'target_size' : np.ndarray
                Size of each region estimated in target atlas

            'overlap_proportion' : list of pd.Series
                Each list contains the proportion of overlap estimated
                between this region and all region in target sizes.
                Sorted according to most strong hit in the overlap.

            'overlap_size' : list
                Each list contain overlap in estimated sizes for all
                regions in target atlas.

    save_labels : dict
        List of original labels specific to each atlas. Useful
        for matching the overlap for the visualization of
        records.
